I totally see what you are saying on one hand , on the other , my relative ( who I live with ) has MND, so if I had symptoms and I confirmed it was Coronavirus I’d have to move out as it could be deadly to him if he caught it ( pneumonia and breathing difficulties are common causes of death for MND patients ) . If it were just a flu , which I have had around him before , I wouldn’t need to move out , this seems to attack the lungs a lot more aggressively.   I think people will not want to isolate and will take risks if they can just pass it off as ‘ the flu’. Personally, having the flu changed my routine very little , maybe more fluids and no kissing / hugging , but if I tested positive for Coronavirus I’d quarantine myself as it seems more contagious and deadly to those with compromised immune systems .",0,0,1
