Just about two weeks in when I thought I was getting better, all the sudden I started spiking a fever of 102 and had a really dry cough and a hard time breathing. It got bad enough that I went to urgent care (which I never do, but I was literally sicker than I've ever been) and when I told the doctor my symptoms, he said it was probably bronchitis and there wasn't much he could do. It was really bad for about a week, and then there was another week of still feeling terrible and ultra fatigued but no fever. No matter how many decongestants I took, I couldn't cough anything up. And then when it went away, it just...went away. I never coughed anything up, my lungs just stopped being inflamed and I could breathe better. I didn't have the lingering cough that I've had in the past with bronchitis. In fact, it was worse than any bronchitis I've ever had.    I didn't really give this much second thought during this current outbreak other than ""fuck, last time a cold did me so bad that this shit might kill me"", but a friend shared something on twitter that was suggesting that there has been a spike in what were originally thought to be flu cases even all the way back to December, and that there is thought that some of these could've been COVID-19 cases that we didn't know about. It has me thinking now, especially because my best friend (who was the first to get sick) started a new job last summer that had her flying around the country twice a week every other week.
