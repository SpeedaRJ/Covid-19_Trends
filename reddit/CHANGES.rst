Change Log
==========

0.0.10 (...)

* Added metadata fetching.
* Added warn/throw options upon detection that PushShift shards are down (per available metadata).
* Documentation improvements.

0.0.9 (2020/03/08)

  a new psaw instance is created.

0.0.6 (2018/08/06)
------------------
* Fixed `aggs` support.
  * If an aggs parameter is provided to a search method, it will be returned as the first result.
  * Subsequent results will be yielded as though there was no aggs parameter.

    way to page for additional results.
